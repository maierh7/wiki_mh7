tells the function how much the character have to occur.

following key sequence. C-SPC C-s <pattern> RET C-w. First set the
active mark. Then search interactively for the desired pattern. And
then use the kill-region command (C-w) to remove the part between the
mark and including the searched pattern.

narrow a region and then apply a different mode.
