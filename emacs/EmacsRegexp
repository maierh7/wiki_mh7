    list of expression this can be used as follows: abc\\|bce to set
    abcXXX or bceXXX wiht \&XXX.

** Performance

Stefan Monnier:

Not really.  What you need to know is that Emacs's regexp engine is
based on backtracking, so things like .*\\(.*\\).* is insanely
inefficient and will make you think Emacs is frozen.

Generally, you'll prefer to use regexps that don't require backtracking.
E.g. [^(\n]*( works much better than .*( since when encountering an open
parenthesis, the matcher will know for sure that it has to leave the *
loop, rather than having to try both cases in sequence.

** Shy Groups

Stefan Monnier:

The \(..\) subgroups are cheap, so I wouldn't worry about them
w.r.t performance.  If you really care about their performance impact,
you can use the non-numbered (aka "shy") groups which are written
\(?:...\), but I doubt you'd be able to measure a difference.
