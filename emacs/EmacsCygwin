This page describes the emacs setup so that it works inside the cygwin
environment and the maierh local environment. This means primarily
starting emacs from a bash environment. Make sure that the *OSTYPE*
environment variable is exported and also create for each drive letter
a cygwin mount point. The cygwin-mount.el lisp file will be start
later in the w32.el lisp file.

<example>

  $  mount c: /c
  $  mount d: /d
