Mouse-1 in the Buffer Name cycles to the next buffer.
Mouse-3 in the Buffer Name cycles to the prev buffer.


Mouse-3 in the Minor Modes list in the Modeline activates a popup

*** Deleting Minor Modes

How to remove from the *modeline* unwanted or always available minor
mode entries such as "omit" or "abbrev"?

Kevin Rodgers suggested to delete the unwanted entry.

<example>

(setq minor-mode-alist
      (delq (assq 'abbrev-mode minor-mode-alist) 
            minor-mode-alist))

</example>

In the case of *dired-omit-files-p* do not set this with the
customization facility. This sets the variable in a global manner so
that each buffer has then the string "Omit" in it. set the flag in the
*dired-mode-hook*.

The same can be done with the *diminish.el* package.

<example>

(diminish 'abbrev-mode)

</example>
