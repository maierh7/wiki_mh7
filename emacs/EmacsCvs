  - *C* (commit) works either for the current file or the directory where
    point is in.

  - *A* (add change log entry in the cvs buffer) calls the toplevel
    change log file not the change log file in the directory where
    the file resides.

  - *M* mark all files
  
  - *f* find-file
  - *o* find-file-other-window.
