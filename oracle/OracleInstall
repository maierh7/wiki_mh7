** dbstart (9.2.0) problem 


  dbstart looks for the pfile in a different place. Workaround
  is to create a link *init{ORASID}.ora* to the *spfile{ORASID}.ora* file
  in the 9.2.0/dbs directory.

** httpd

  - Starting of httpd at boot time fails because the *DISPLAY*
  environment is not defined.

  - Edit the file = $ORACLE_HOME/Apache/Jserv/etc/jserv.properties =
  and then set the following line in comments:

  <example>
  wrapper.env.copy=DISPLAY
  </example>

** httpd ssl

  - apachectl startssl
