** Subqueries

  <example>
    select * 
    from emp 
    where (empno, sal) in (
      select empno, sal
      from emp
      where empno = 7900
      and   sal   = 950
    );
  </example>

** Subqueries Exists

  - The **exists** operator is *true* if the subquery at least returns
    *one* row. Below the result is all columns from emp if one
    employee exists that meets the two values.

  <example>
    select * 
    from emp
    where exists (
      select empno, sal
      from emp
      where empno = 7900
      and   sal   = 950
    ); 
  </example>
