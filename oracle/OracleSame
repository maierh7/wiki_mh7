** Througput

    - Transfer time > 5 * positioning time

** Transfer Rate

    - Outer edge 22 MB/sec
    - Inner edge 11 MB/sec

** Seek Time

    -  1 ms to the next track
    - 10 ms for the entire disk

** Summary to optimize bandwith

    - Stripe data to equalize the workload across disks to eliminate
      hotspots

    - Stripe data to enable many disks to serve requests

    - Ensure that sequential access occurs in a least 1 MB units

    - Place data to the outer half disk to provide faster transfer
      rates

    - Place data to the outer half to minimize seek overhead
