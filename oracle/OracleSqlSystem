** Log File

<example>
  SQL> alter system switch logfile;
</example>

- Causes LGWR to start writing redo to the next log. If you happen to
  be in archive log mode, it happens to also cause the log being
  switched away from to be archived. Works whether in archive log mode
  or not.

<example>
  SQL> alter system archive log current;
</example>

- Causes the current log to be archived, and happens to also induce a
  log switch. Not a meaningful command if you're not in archive log
  mode. In a RAC environment this causes all instances to switch the
  log files.


** Sessions

<example>
  SQL> alter system kill session 'sid,serial#' immediate;
</example>

- See to the file dba-v-session.sql.

** Shared Pool

<example>
  SQL> alter system flush shared_pool;
</example>
