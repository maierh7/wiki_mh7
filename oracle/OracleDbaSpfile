By default, the initSID.ora is stored in ORACLE_HOME/dbs (or
ORACLE_HOME\database on Windows). But you will also find that the
database creation assistant sets up an ORADATA\ADMIN directory under
ORACLE_BASE (usually C:\oracle on Windows platforms). In there, you'll
find a PFILE directory, and in there, you'll find the *real*
initSID.ora. The one in ORACLE_HOME\database merely has a line in it
saying where to find the other one
(IFILE=C:\oracle\oradata\admin\file\initxxx.ora).

So editing the one with numbers after it is not going to help you at all.

If there's an SPFILE, it also has to live in ORACLE_HOME\database, but
you can again move it anywhere so long as you leave a regular init.ora
behind that has one line in it:
SPFILE=C:\somwhere\somewherelse\spfilexxx.ora.

There are some advantages to using an SPFILE, and some known
disadvantages. The advantages are that when you modify a dynamic
parameter (alter system set shared_pool_size=120M), that implicitly
not only changes the currently running instance, but modifies the
spfile setting as well, so the next time you startup, the new setting
is already in place. In the dark old days before 9i, achieving both
things would have involved issuing the alter system command to get the
currently-running instance right, and *then* remembering to edit your
init.ora yourself (and yes, I realise that before 9i, you couldn't
actually modify the shared_pool_size dynamically).

Big deal, as far as I'm concerned: it's shifted the burden in other
respects. 'Alter system' commands used to have no lasting effect. Now,
by default, they do. So if I want to make just a temporary change to
the currently running instance, I have to remember to append the
'SCOPE=MEMORY' clause to the alter system command so it doesn't try
and edit my spfile.

Then there are the bugs: try changing the DISPATCHERS= parameter with
an alter system command, with no SCOPE clause. It won't work, because
you can't, for some reason, edit that parameter in the spfile. At all.

Then there are the quirks. Try 'alter system set shared_pool_size=0
scope=spfile'. Zero is, of course, an utterly illegal value, but the
spfile is merrily altered anyway.

Then there's the rigmarole of correcting such quirks, or modifying
your DISPATCHERS parameter: create pfile from spfile. Edit the
traditional init.ora that results. Then create spfile from pfile. Then
startup. Strikes me it was easier just to: edit init.ora, startup.

There are two occasions when you *have* to use an spfile: Data Guard
requires it (standby databases). And so does RAC *if* you are using
raw devices and want to have a common configuration file (because you
can't put a text file init.ora onto a raw partition).

And there is one major plus point in the spfile's favour: there's only
ever one of them. If you have a team of DBAs, each managing the
database from their own PCs using Enterprise Manager, each DBA has a
local copy of the init.ora. So which one is the 'right' one? With the
SPFILE, everything stays on the server end, and there's no confusion
about what file is the definitive one.

Like anything else, therefore, it's a tool which you may or may not
find helpful or a hinderance, and which has benefits as well as
costs. Personally, unless I'm working with Data Guard, I never have
one (most RAC implementations these days could use a cluster file
system, onto which an init.ora *can* be placed for common-file
configuration). But it's, as ever, an 'all depends' situation at the
moment. Give it enough time, though, and I expect it will be the only
way to do things.
