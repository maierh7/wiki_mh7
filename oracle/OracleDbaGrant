** grant/revoke sysdba

  - See also the 'Database Administrator Guide (SAG)'. The orapw<sid>
  file will be created by default and is located under '?/dbs'.

  <example>
    SQL> grant  sysdba to ops$midba;
    SQL> revoke sysdba from ops$midba;
  </example>

  - Another possibility is to give another user the *dba* or OSDBA
    group id.

  - Query v$pwfile_users.

** connect as sysdba

  <example>
    SQL> connect scott/tiger as sysdba;
  </example>

** read only access

  <example>
    SQL> GRANT CREATE SESSION TO ...
    SQL> GRANT SELECT ON ... TO ...
  </example>

** Create User

  <example>
    SQL> create user scott identified by tiger;
  </example>


** Remove whole User

  <example>
    SQL> drop user scott cascade;
  </example>

    No it isn't. According to the ANSI SQL standard, only the owner of
    the schema has the privilege to administer grants for his own
    objects, but can delegate the authority (grant with admin). That
    is exactly what happened with all the precreated objects.

** Granting the Connect Privilege

  <example>
    SQL> create user foo identified by foo;
    SQL> grant create session to foo;
    SQL> grant alter session to foo;
  </example>

  - Alter session it's necessary if someone wants to change the
    password.


** Password Checking

  - $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/utlpwdmg.sql

** Directories

  - grant read on directory media_dir to public;


** Dictionary

  - *session_roles*
  - *session_privs*

  - grant select any dictionary to dbo;

** Access to V$ Tables

  <example>
    SQL> grant select on v_$instance to dbo;
  </example>

  - This gives the user DBO the permission to select the dynamic view
    v$instance.
