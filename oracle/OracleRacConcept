
** Differences to a Single Instance

  - Each Instance has its own redo thread
  - Each Instance has its own undo tablespace

** Different ORACLE_HOMES per Node

  - Simpliefies rolling upgrades. But only for the physical files. The
    catalog upgrade in the database is allways for the whole database.

  - Conclusion the upgrade process should always be tested on a
    different system and then afterward applied to the production
    system. So a different ORACLE_HOME is not necessary. On the other
    side the cluster concept copies the physical files to the
    different node so it doesn't matter.


** Voting Disk

  - The voting disk must reside on shared disk and should be
    multiplexed (3 is recommend). These 3 files should be provided
    redundant with external mirroring.

** Oracle Cluster Registry (OCR)

  - The OCR must also reside on shared disk and should be multiplexed
    too and mirrored with external redundancy.
