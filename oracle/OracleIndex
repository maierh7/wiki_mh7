** General

  - Oracle Indices are always balanced and this means to create them
    only if it's necessary because updating of an index is almost
    expensive.

** Index Usage

  - If you're running 9.x, you can issue the following: = alter index
    index_name monitoring usage = then query v$object_usage. Another
    possibility would be to look at v$segment_statistics.
