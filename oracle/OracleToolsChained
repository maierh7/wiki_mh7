If you mean 'how do I identify which rows exactly have migrated', just
run the script utlchain.sql (in ye ever handy ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin
directory) to create a table called 'chained_rows', and then do
'analyze table BLAH list chained rows'. If you select * from
chained_rows after that, you will have the head rowids for each of the
migrated rows. If you include a subselect from the main table
(something like 'select * from chained_rows where head_rowid in
(select * from BLAH)' ) then you can see the data that's involved.
