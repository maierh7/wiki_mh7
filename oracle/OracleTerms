** Oracle Terms

- *Cardinality*. Number of distinct values in a particular column.

- *Selectivity*. The relationship between cardinality and rows.

	selectivity = cardinality / number of rows

- *Alter Database*. Is true for ever, because written to the control
  files. OracleSqlDatabase.

- *Alter System*. Is only true for the lifetime of the instance. The
  introduction of the spfile (9i) makes the changes too permanent.
  OracleSqlSystem.

- *Autoalogated Extents*. OracleTerms#LMT.

- *Automatic Segment Space Management*. H.J.R.: ASSM has signifcant
  overheads.

_ *Block Size*. Should be the same as the filesystem. Multiple Block
  Size feature should not be used.

- *Chained Rows*.  OracleTools#Chained.

- *Consistent Backup*. Backup of the database with a clean shutdown.

#Control.
- *Control File*. Stores the pyhsical structure of a database. Designed
  for multiplexing. See OracleTermsFiles.

- *Data Guard*. OracleTerms#Standby.

#Denormalization
- *Denormalization*. It is normally not used in a OLTP system. It
  might be make sense in a Data Ware House system.

- *Disaster Recovery*.

- *Enqueue*. OracleTermsLock.

- *Extent*. Initial Extent and Incremental Extent.

- *Failsafe*. See metalink for the documentation.

- *Free Space Management*. Should be done automatically.

- *Inconsistent Backup*. Backup of the database files without a clean
  shutdown of the database. Note: a 'shutdown abort' is also a
  inconsistent backup. Afterward it requires a recovery.

- *Inconsistent Closed Backup*. After a system crash or after a
  'shutdown abort' if *archivelog* is on. In noarchivelog mode the SCN
  differs and so recovery may not be valid.

- *Inline View Subquery*. See OracleSqlTerms.

- *Instance*. SGA + Oracle processes.

- *Latch*. OracleTermLock

#LMT
- *Locally Managed Tables*. Types are uniform and autoallogate
  (system-managed) extents.

#Logical
- *Logical Structures*. Schemas, Blocks, Extents, Segments, Tablespaces.
  See Physical Structure (OracleTerms#Physical).

- *Lock*. OracleTermLock

- *Materialized View*.

- *Normalization*. OracleTerms#Denormalization.

- *Performance*. OraclePerformance

#Physical
- *Physical Structure*. Datafiles, control files, redo log files. See
  OracleTerms#Logical, OracleTerms#Control, OracleTerms#Redo.

- *Quiesced State*. Only a DBA can work on the data base.

#Redo
- *Redo Log Files*. Redo log files are only used for recovery. Designed
  for multiplexing.

#RBS
- *Rollback Segment*. OracleTerms#UNDO. In 8i Best would be one
  tablespace per RBS.

- *Scalar Subquery*. See OracleSqlTerms.

- *Segment*. A Segment can span _more_ than one datafile. An extent of a
  segment is always assigned to one datafile. A segment resides always
  in one tablespace.

  1. Data Segment
  2. Index Segment
  3. Temporary Segment. Created by 'temporary tables', 'create index'
     command and by the following sql statements: 'order by',
     'distinct', 'group by', 'intersect', 'union', 'minus'.

- *Shutdown*. Close, Unmount, Shutdown.

#Standby.
- *Standby Database*. A duplicate copy of a primary database (only read
  mode).

- *Startup*. Start, Mount, Open.

- *System Global Area*. It's a shared memory region. It contains data
  buffers, redo log buffers and the shared pool.

- *Tablespace Contents*.

  1. Permanent
  2. Temporary
  3. Undo

- *Tablespace Allocation Type*.

  1. System
  2. Uniform

- *Transaction Control Statement*. See OracleSqlTerms.

#UNDO
- *Undo Tablespace*. OracleTerms#RBS. In 9iR2 one Undo Tablespace
  should be enough.

- *Uniform Extents*. OracleTerms#LMT.
