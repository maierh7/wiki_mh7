** Architectures

  - Thread-Based on Windows. Disadvantage only one address space of 3
    GB. (See too the note 46001.1)

  - Process-Based on Unix. Advantage each process has it's own
    address space.

** LMT vs DMT

  - *DMT* Directory Managed Tables stores the extend information in
    the Database.

  - *LMT* Locally Managed Tables stores the extend info in the
    Datefile itself as a bitmap block. Since Oracle 9 default.

** Reverse Key Index

  - RAC as single Instance: Increasing sequence and many concurrent
    sessions that accesses the same block. This cause contention on
    that block. The increasing sequence numbers go to the same
    block. With reverse key index it will go to different blocks.

  - Deletion of old rows: In this case the free list will not be
    reused.

  - Bad about reversed keys: No range scans (Sigh!!!). Very bad !!!

  - So only use reverse key indexes if lots of session use the same
    keys, especially in a rac environment or if small range deletions
    happens and if the column is not accessed with the like, >,<, or
    between operator.
