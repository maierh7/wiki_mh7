** Possible Problems

  - To due hot spots RAC may not scale well

** Advanced Queuing

  - asign a queue table to a specific instance ID.

** Other Pitfalls

  - serialization
    - monotonically increasing key
    - frequent updates of small chached tables
    - use sparse blocks (pctfree 99)
    - use ASSM

  - full table scans

  - dictionary lookups
    - frequent invalidation of object
    - frequent parsing of cursors

  - concurrent ddl

  - indexes 
    - right growing indexes
    - too much indexes, delete unnecessary indexes

  - SQL which scans large amount of data
    - maybe should be parallelized
    - direct reads because they don't need to be synchronized
