** EXP

  - The exp tool should have always set the *NLS_LANG* variable. This
    prevents from converting the database content.

** compare

  - = NLS_COMP = ansi =. Specifies the comparsion in where clauses.
    This value defaults to binary. If this value is set to ansi then
    it might be good to have a functional index which can be created
    as follows:

  <example>
     SQL> create index i on t(nlssort(col, 'nls_sort=german'));
  </example>


** week calculation

  - = NLS_TERROTORY = germany =. This does not set the NLS_SORT.
    The territory variable can only be set in the init file or with a
    alter session statement. Also it's not possible to set the value
    with the scope 'both' in the alter system command. Only the scope 
    spfile is valid so a restart of the database is necessary.

  <example>
    SQL> alter system set nls_territory = germany scope = spfile;
  </example>


** Info

  - = NLS_DATABASE_PARAMETERS =
  - = NLS_INSTANCE_PARAMETERS =
  - = NLS_SESSION_PARAMETERS =

  - par.pl | grep nls

** Changing the Characterset

  - Best would be to export the database in the current nls
    environment and then to a import to a database with the new
    character set.

** UTF8

  - = NLS_LENGTH_SEMANTICS = Byte or char.

** Euro / SQLPLUS

  - sqlplus needs NLS_LANG with a specified character set otherwise
    it uses as client character set us7ascii.

** Euro / Output

  <example>
    alter session set nls_territory = GERMANY;
    select to_char(100,'U9999') from dual;
    -------
    ¤100
    select '¤' from dual;
    -------
    ¤
  </example>
