** Relink Problems

<pre>
<verbatim>

I don't know much about IAS installs but libknlopt.a should not exist
unless the RDBMS is being installed.  A relink all will try to relink
the rdbms if the $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms directory exists.

Possibly you can simply just ignore the relink errors.

** IAS without Infrastructure

- The **tnsping** program would not work because not all network files
  are installed. sqlplus works fine.
