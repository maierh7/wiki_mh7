** Constraint Types

  - c not null (SYS_%)
  - p primary key 
  - u unique
  - r foreign key
  - c check
  - v with check option on a view
  - o read only on a view

** Check Type

  - initially defered
  - initially immediate

** Constraint Checking

  - If working on bulk of datas it might be good to set the
    constraint checking to defered because the constraints are only
    succeed on the end of the transaction. Use herefor the 'set
    constraint' statement.

  <example>
    set constraint abc defered;
    -- or
    set constraints all defered;
    -- or
    alter session set ...
  </example>

** Check Before Commit

  <example>
  ...
  set constraints all immediate;
  </example>

** Disable a Constraint

  <example>
    SQL> alter table <table> constraint disable <constraint>;
  </example>

** Constraint Failed
