A latch is a type of lock.

A latch is a light weight serialization device, typically used to
serialize access to a shared data structure. It is normally
implemented as a single "test and set" instruction although this
varies by OS.

A latch is a lock in that respect.

In Oracle the other major type of lock is called an enqueue. They are
implemented differently from latches and are somewhat "heavier".  A
session that is waiting for a row that is being updated by another
session is "enqueued" on that other sessions transaction -- it is
waiting for that session to commit.


An exclusive lock is a lock that only one session at a time can have.
If I lock a table in exclusive mode -- no other session can.
Subordinate locks, like a "share lock" on the table are prohibited as
well.


A shared lock is a lock that ma ny people can get at the same time.
Two sessions can simultaneously lock a table in share mode.


A dead lock is when two sessions are blocked on eachother waiting for
a resource the other has.  For example:


Session 1           Session 2
lock table t1
in exclusive mode;
                    lock table t2
                    in exclusive mode;
lock table t2
in exclusive mode;                       <<<<<====== he is blocked
                    lock table t1 
                    in exclusive mode;   <<<<<------ they are deadlocked

the system will detect that and fail one of the above last two statements.
