** Result

  - *parse*   Soft or hard parse phase

  - *execute* For a select, this will be many time empty. For update,
    this will be where all of the work is done.

  - *fetch*   Fetching rows.

** Result Columns

  - count
  - cpu     Timed_statistics need to be on
  - elapsed Ditto
  - disk    I/O performance
  - query   How many blocks are read
  - current
  - rows    How many rows

** Analysis

  - *parse / execute equal one* Always hard parses. Should be go to
    zero.

  - *parse greater one is alwys suspect* Always hard parses.

  - *execute count equal one* No bind variables.

  - *large disparity between cpu and elapsed* A lot of time of waits.

  - *large cpu or elapsed time* Tune it.

  - *fetch near one and rows greater one* No bulk fetches. [1]

  - *excessively high disk*. Suspect.

  - *excessively high query or current*. Suspect.

  - *Misses in library cache during parse: 1* Always hard parses.


** Trace File

  - **dep** Recursive SQL. A value greater zero means that the SQL is
    executed by the database and not by the client. This is true for
    SQL inside PL/SQL.
