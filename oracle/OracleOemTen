** Setup

  OracleOemTenSetup

** OMA (agent)

  - For each host.

  - emctl upload
  - emctl reload (targets.xml)
  - emctl config agent listtargets
  - emctl status blackout (lists blackouts on the current managed host)
  - emctl secure oms -sysman_pwd 

** OMA Discover

  - agentca -d

If the targets.xml file needs to be edit, then substitute the
AGETN_TOKEN with an AGENT_SEED. The seed number is in the
emd.properties file and reinvoke 'agentca -d'. Best would be if the
targets in the OMS are first deleted. After uploading delete again the
targets that are not necessary.
