** OSX Keyboard

  - set Keyboard to Macintosh

** Xmodmap

Setting the keyboard with xmodmap should be done after the X
initialization is ready. A good solution might be to look for
"Mode_switch" in the .bashrc. If this doesn't exist then set it.

<example>
clear mod1
clear mod2
clear mod4

keycode 115 = Alt_L
keycode  64 = Super_L
keycode 113 = Mode_switch

add mod1 = Alt_L Meta_L
add mod2 = Mode_switch
add mod4 = Super_L Hyper_L
</example>
