** Create Html Picture Page

Use either pic_get.sh or pic_rename.sh. pic_rename.sh renames all the
pics in the current directory to a file name with <prefix>_nnn.jpg.

** Piclist

The piclist may not include double quotes. Use instead double quotes
single quotes.

** Example

<example>

$ pic_get.sh     aa ~/photo/2002/dana
$ pic_rename.sh  aa

$ pic_reduce.sh  aa
$ pic_small.sh   aa
$ pic_piclist.sh aa
$ pic_album.sh -t 'Title' aa < piclist

</example>

** Todo

Expand piclist to use references to the real pictures. The piclist
should be in a pictures directory. The script will look for the
pictures too in sibling directories.

Allow too html code at top and bottom of the album.html file.

<example>
p0001535 This is the text for the picture 'p0001535'.
p0001634 Another example for a description.
</example>
