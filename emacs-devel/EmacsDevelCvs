It's very simple to get the diffs yourself:

cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.gnu.org:/cvsroot/emacs login
[hit Enter when it asks for a password]
cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.gnu.org:/cvsroot/emacs co
emacs/lisp/gnus/ChangeLog

Now look in gnus/ChangeLog, and you will see that the latest changes are in
mm-util.el and nntp.el.  The next step is this:

cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.gnu.org:/cvsroot/emacs log -h emacs/lisp/nntp.el

This will show what is the latest version of nntp.el.  Let's say it's
1.234.  Now (put the -d :pserver etc. stuff instead of the ellipsis):

cvs ... diff -u -r1.233 -r1.234 emacs/lisp/nntp.el > nntp.dif
patch --binary -p0 -b < nntp.dif

And similarly for mm-util.el.
