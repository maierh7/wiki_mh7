For some problems, you will have no other choice but to use GDB.  It's 
not that hard, really; and you can get help here if you get stuck.

Anyway, here's some hints about debugging this on the Lisp level:

  - *byte-compile* all the .el files for which temacs says it is
    loading the (stale) .elc file.  You might be having trouble
    because old .elc files conflict with the new C code.

  - If "make" still produces the same error after you byte-compile all
    the new .el files, try this:

	cd src
	./temacs -q
	M-x set-variable RET debug-on-error RET t RET
	M-x load-library RET loadup RET

This will load all the packages specified by loadup.el, but
interactively.  With any luck, you will get a backtrace when it hits
the problem.

If the above doesn't help, I'd suggest to run temacs under GDB, set a
breakpoint in Fsignal, type "run -batch -l loadup", and examine things
when that breakpoint breaks.  See etc/DEBUG for some useful techniques
about accessing Lisp information from GDB.
