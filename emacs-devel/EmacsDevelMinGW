This describes how to build emacs with the mingw package. Get the
mingw package from http://www.mingw.org and set the path to the mingw
bin directory. Then go to emacs-21.1/nt directory and call
configure.bat for gcc.

<example>

  [nt] $ mingw 

               # mingw is a bash function that puts in front of the
               # path the mingw bin directory.

  [nt] $ ./configure.bat --with-gcc
  [nt] $ make  
  [nt] $ make install INSTALL_DIR=d:/Programme/emacs-21.1-mingw

</example>
