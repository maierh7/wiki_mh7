Both the new mingw and the cygwin debugger are possible. To debug
emacs inside a emacs **gud** buffer use the mingw port. The cygwin port is
the **insight** gdb debugger.

Requirements:

  - *emacs_dir* environment variable
  - Go to the *src* directory.

*** Watching a Lisp Symbol by Stefan Monnier

Sadly there is no such thing as a "watcher" for variables in elisp.
So the only way I can think of is to use GDB to put a watchpoint on
the memory cell.  From GDB you can call

   print intern ("ispell-dictionary")

and then use

   xsymbol

to deal with the tag bits and get at the underlying Lisp_Symbol
pointer.  Then a

   watch $2->value

should do trick.


*** Analyse Looping

  - *gdb emacs*
  - *kill -TSTP PID*
  - *xbacktrace*
