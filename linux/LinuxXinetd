** Starting

  - At least one service needs to be enabled. For example go to the
    /etc/xinetd.d/ directory and enable the printer service. The line
    with *disable* needs *no*.

   <pre>
   <verbatim>
   --- /etc/xinetd.d/cups-lpd ---
   service printer
   {
	disable     = no
	flags       = NAMEINARGS
	socket_type = stream
	protocol    = tcp
	wait        = no
	user        = lp
	server      = /usr/lib/cups/daemon/cups-lpd
	server_args = cups-lpd -o document-format=application/octet-stream 
   }
   </verbatim>
   </pre>
