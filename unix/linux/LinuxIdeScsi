** Enabling of a ATAPI CDROM Drive to Burn CDs

The ide cd drive is here called hdc. If it is another character
e.g. hdd then replace hdc with hdc.

  - *ide-scsi* this should be loaded by insmod

  - *modules.conf* add line "options ide-cd ignore=hdc". This is not
    a requirement. See athene there the modules.conf file did not
    contain this option.

  - *append* the kernel command line to use the ide-scsi interface.
    E.g. add in **/etc/lilo.conf** the line "append hdc=ide-scsi" to the
    actual kernel. After editing create a new boot record with
    **/sbin/lilo**.
