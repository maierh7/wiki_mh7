*iconv* translates from one character encoding to another. For example,
to convert a buffer from Shift-JIS to EUC-JP:

<example>

#include <iconv.h>
iconv_tconversion_descriptor = iconv_open ("EUC-JP", "SHIFT-JIS");
size_t chars_converted = iconv (conversion_descriptor,
                                &inbuf, &insize, &outbuf, &outsize);
iconv_close (conversion_descriptor);

</example>

*iconv* is becoming the standard way to convert encodings on GNU and on
Unix systems.  It is specified by POSIX 1003.1-2001, which was just
approved last week.  Unfortunately, though, the POSIX standard is
incomplete, as the character encoding names themselves are not
standardized.
