    minimum. And yes, Windows ripped along. But Oracle on Linux is
    making Oracle on Windows look like a slug in a wheelchair with its
    brakes on, running over some freshly-poured tarmac on a really hot
    day.

  - *Thomas Kyte* at Ask Tom 01.12.2003: I think that the people who
    will stay employed in the future will do one of two things:

    1. Be both a developer and a DBA. This is hard to do, but the
       number of jobs available is small enough that employers can
       demand both. This increases efficiency of the position. So DBAs
       will be responsible for keeping the database up, etc... and
       handling the bulk of the complex PL/SQL, plus helping object
       oriented developers with Oracle. Most DBAs are pretty weak in
       PL/SQL and development. Many will have to change or they will
       see themselves out of work or in lower paying positions.

    2. Be both an object oriented and Oracle developer. This is easier
       to break into if you are coming from the OO world, since few if
       any employers will give oracle developers the opportunity to do
       object oriented programming.
