** Byte Semantics

  - Is default since perl 5.8.

  - use bytes;

** Set Stream to UTF-8

  - binmode(STDOUT, ":utf8");

** Open Stream in UTF-8

  - open FH, ">:utf8", "file";

** Create a UTF-8 Character

  - chr ();

** Decode a Character

  - ord ();

** \N and \x

  - Interpreted at compile time. So don't use variables in it. Use
    instead 'chr' and 'charnames::vianame'.
