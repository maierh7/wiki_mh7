** xset

  See also XtoolsFs. Note *localhost* as host name did not werk.

  In a Exceed context this will perhaps be best in a .profile. 
  For the LOCAL setup the best solution in the '*.profile.local*'. 
  Another solution can be the '*local/profile*' file.

<example>

  $ xset -fp tcp/vsun03:7100
  $ xset fp rehash

</example>
