** Network

     *- config* /etc/X11/fs/config and /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fs/config.
     Remove the line **no-listen = tcp**. To due a security issue the
     option no-listen was added. To get the **network** capability the
     option was added. To figure out the problem use

     <example>
        $ xfsinfo -server <hostname>:7100
     </example>

     If this not work then remove the no-listen option.

     *- activate* see XtoolsSet
