** Administration

  - *swat* http://localhost:901. Requirement for swat is enabling in the
    inetd.conf file and a running web server.


** Passwords

The user name to the smbpasswd command is the unix user name and the
unix passwd. Seems reasonable because we want to connect to the unix
server.

<example>
# smbpasswd -a maierh
</example>
