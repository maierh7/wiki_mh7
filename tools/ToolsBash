** Use Login Shell

  - *#! /bin/bash --login*. Especially in the .xsession file or in other
    initialization files.

  - *auto logoff* can be activated by the enviroment TMOUT.

** Default Values

  - ${var:=10}. Note this works not for command line arguments.

** Non-Interactive Shell

  - In this case bash reads the file in *$BASH_ENV*. Similiar to $ENV
    sh.

** Concepts

  - login interactive shell
  - interactive shell
  - non interactive shell

** Return vs. Exit

  - In proceure/functions always use return instead of exit.

** Functions

  - *command* allows to call a command that is also defined as a
    function.

  <example>
    ls() {
      command ls --color $@
    }
  </example>

** Passing Arguments

  - = "$@" = Use quotes by bassing arguments. This keeps the
    quotation.

** Options

  - shopt
  - shopt -s <opt> # enable the option
  - shopt -u <opt> # disable the option

Note: "shopt" is different from "set -o".

** PipeFail

  - set -o pipefail

In this case bash returns as exit status the last failing command in a
pipe. Default is to return the last exit status.

** Restricted Shells

  - set -r

This disables some comands such as 

  - cd
  - changing the $PATH, $SHELL, and env variables
  - changing the $SHELLOPTS
  - output redirection
  - invoking commands containing on or more /'s
  - invoking exec
  - getting out of the restricted mode in the script

** Debug

  - set -n checks for syntax errors
  - set -v echoes each command before executing
  - set -x echoes the result of each command

** Trap

  - trap '' 2 disbables C-c
  - trap 2    enables   C-c
