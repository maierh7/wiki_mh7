** Options

See also ToolsSshOptions.

** Fingerprint

  - ssh-keygen -lf id_rsa

** Version 2 

A version 2 key can be generated by the command *ssh-keygen -d* or
otherwise the ssh command needs the *-1* option.

The version can be configured in the /etc(/ssh)/ssh<_>config or in the
~/.ssh/config file. To use identity.pub you have to specify version 1
as the used protocol:

  Protocol 1,2 

** Other Versions

  - ssh-keygen *-t* [rsa1,rsa,dsa]. See also ssh-keygen.sh

** Security Problems

  - *open ssh 2.3*
  - *ssh 1.2.26 - 1.2.31*

** Scripts

  - *ssh-keygen.sh* Installs the public keys of current user
    to user@host.

  - *ssh-auth.sh* Lists the entries of authorized_keys of user@host.

** Problems

  - The first time ssh connects to another user the host will be
    queried whether it is a secure host. That is true too for
    *localhost*.

** Proxies

  - See the connect program.

** Environment

  - sshd_config: PermitUserEnvironment yes
  - ~/.ssh/environment (This is on the remote site)

** Authentification

  - Password
  - Public-Key
  - Host-based
  - Certificate
  - Kerberos
  - PAM
  - Secure ID
