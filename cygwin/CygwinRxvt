** How to Run?

  - rxvt.exe has compiled in both supports for X11 and Windows. With
    a DISPLAY environment it tries to start the X11 version otherwise
    it starts the Window versions.

** Problems

  - How to start rxvt.exe so it finds the right ~/.bashrc. It looks
    that the '~' does not point to '/f/home/maierh'.
