** General

"Changing a buffer's text properties marks the buffer as modified,
while moving an overlay or changing its properties does not. Unlike
text property changes, overlay changes are not recorded in the
buffer's undo list."

<example>

(defun abc ()

  (interactive)
  (let (
	(mod (buffer-modified-p))
	(buffer-undo-list)
	)
    (set-text-properties 1 5 '(face 'bold))
    (restore-buffer-modified-p mod)))

</example>



- *put-text-property*
- *add-text-properties*
- *set-text-properties*
- *remove-text-properties*
- *list-text-properties-at* lists the properties at point
