- *w32-shell-execute* opens a document via the system open
  facility. Note the function cannot handle the tilde in a document
  name. To get a dos file syntax call 'cygpath -w <path>'.

<example>
(let ((s (shell-command-to-string "cygpath -w/cygdrive/c/tmp/abc.exe")))
   (w32-shell-execute "open" s)
   (w32-shell-execute "open" "f:/home/maierh/tmp/otl3.doc")
   )
</example>


- *convert-standard-filename* is another possibility to translate the
  file name in a DOS syntax. The disadvantage currently is that the
  function looks too to the currently used shell.

<example>
(convert-standard-filename "c:/foo/bar")
</example>

  Another example sets the **directory-sep-char**:

<example>
(defun dos-canonical-name (filename)
"Canonicalize filename forcing `\\' as directory-sep-char."
  (let ((directory-sep-char ?\ ))
    (expand-file-name filename)))
</example>
