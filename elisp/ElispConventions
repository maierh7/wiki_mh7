** General

Use a feature test instead of a check of the system-type. For example
the current tool-bar under X is not ready for the Windows system. But
this feature may in future versions of Emacs exist. Only checking the
system type would mean that this have to change later then the feature
is also available on Windows.

Eli suggests:

Don't use window-system. Better try to test a feature with featurep or
a function with fboundp. If this is not possible then the usage of
display-graphic-p is always better.


<example>

;; The function executable-make.* did not exist in emacs 20. But to
;; test this it's better to test the existence of the function instead 
;; of testing the emacs version number.

(when (fboundp 'executable-make-buffer-file-executable-if-script-p)
  (add-hook 'after-save-hook 
	    'executable-make-buffer-file-executable-if-script-p
	    ))
</example>


** Hooks

Always set a hook variable to nil so that the variable exists for byte
compiling.
