- *w32-shell-execute* See the ElispWindowsShell contains examples how
  to execute native Windows programs in the Windows environment.

- *(w32-send-sys-command #xf030)* maximies emacs under Windows

- *w32-quote-process-args* quotes all the arguments with quotes. The
  default value is t. Jason wrote that this variable should not be set
  by the user. A value of t means that emacs tries to detect the
