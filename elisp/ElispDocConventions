** General

Don't use uppercase lisp symbols in documentation strings such as
'NIL'.

Avoid passive wording such as 'and the Slovak tutorial is
selected'. Use instead a active wording such as 'and selects the
Slovak tutorial.


RMS gives another example in emacs-devel:

  "File %s is modified in buffer %s. Insert it? "

Be VERY careful about using pronouns in writing, and especially in
short statements like that one.
 
  "File %s is being edited.  Insert the file anyway? "

would be a clearer message.


** Test

Use 'checkdoc'. This tests the elisp code if all the documentation
conventions are valid.
