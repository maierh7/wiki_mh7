It' s a recommend way not to bother other user with requiring the cl
package. Usage of the package in a byte compiled context is not a
problem. So the cl package can be used as follows:

<example>
(eval-when-compile (require 'cl))
</example>

I assume that explicit requiring of the cl package would also work.
