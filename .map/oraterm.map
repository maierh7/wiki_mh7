*active sessions
Active sessions are in transaction, in querying or uses other database
resources such as enqueues.
*advancing the checkpoint
This reduces recovery because the changes are written to the datafile
and the checkpoint is moved forward. Afterward the SCN changes.

file and redo log information, datafile copy information, current log
sequence number, checkpoint information (scn).

Happens by updates then the row does not fit in the current data block
after update. Then the entire row is migrated to a new data block. The

*service handlers
dispatcher (shared server) or dedicated servers.
*service name
Defaults to the global database name (db_name + db_domain).
*service registration
PMON registers the database instance by the listener. This means it is
not necessary to add this instance into the listener.ora file. An
entry in the listener.ora file is only necessary for OEM.
*sga
Database buffers, redo log buffers, shared pool and large pool
(context areas). The SGA should fit in real memory.

user-accessible data.
*tablespaces
TSs are the logical storage units. They group logical structures
together.

index, .. oder by, distinct, group by, union, intersect, minus. Also
temporary tables use temporary segments.  See too the init parameter
SORT_AREA_SIZE.
*temporary tables
Temporary tables can be session specific or transaction specific. They
do not generate redo logs. In both types the contents of the table is
only visible to the current session. It's possible to create indexes
for temporary tables. They are also temporary. Temporary tables are 
using temporary segments.
*temporary tablespace
OMF creates a temporary tablespace TEMP by default. Otherwise use the
default temporary tablespace <name> clause by the create or alter
database statement. A locally managed SYSTEM tablespace cannot be used
as temporary tablespace.
*terminate session
Use "alter system kill session '7,5'". 7 is the sid and 5 is the
serial#. Both values must be specified.

kept. The unit is seconds. Default is 15 minutes. OUI sets as default
180 minutes. If a error message 'snapshot to old' is raised then may
be this parameter should be increased.
*undo tablespace
A system can have many undo tablespaces. Especially in a RAC each
instance has its own tablespace. A undo tablespace entry can be
changed with the alter system set command because UNDO_TABLESPACE is a
init parmeter.
