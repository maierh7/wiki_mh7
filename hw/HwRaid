  - *RAID 0* = performance (striping). One disk - multiple controlers
    that access the disk in parallel.
  - *RAID 1* = safety (mirrorring). most secure.
  - *RAID 3* =
  - *RAID 5* = compromise between performance and safety
  - *RAID 7* =
  - *RAID 0+1* = performance and safety without compromise
